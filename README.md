# Image Slider

This is a simple image slider built with HTML and CSS.

## Features

* Displays a horizontal carousel of images.
* Uses scroll snapping for smooth transitions.
* Includes navigation dots for easy image selection.

## How to Use

1. **Images:**  Make sure you have image files named `space-1.jpeg` to `space-10.jpeg` (or any other names you prefer) in a folder named `images` within your project directory.
2. **Customization:** You can edit the styles in the `style.css` file to change the appearance of the slider, such as size, colors, and spacing.

## Code Breakdown

**HTML:**

* The HTML structure defines the overall layout of the slider, including sections for the slider container, navigation dots, and individual images.
* The `TODO` comments indicate areas where you might need to add more navigation dots if you add more images.

**CSS:**

* The CSS styles control the visual aspects of the slider, including positioning, sizing, responsiveness, and animations.

## Browser Support

This slider should work on most modern web browsers.
